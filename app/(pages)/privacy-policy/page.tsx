      <p className="mb-4">
        IntellicPDF is currently a personal portfolio project created for
        educational and demonstration purposes. While the service is functional,
        it may not yet meet enterprise-grade standards. In the future, we may
        evolve this project into a full SaaS business with improved features,
        security, and user controls.
